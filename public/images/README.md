# DevBraze Chip Hero Image

Please place your chip image (`download (3).jpeg`) at:
`/public/images/chip-hero.jpg`

The image should be:
- High resolution (1800-2200px wide)
- Optimized for web
- Shows a futuristic microchip with blue/cyan tones
- Good contrast for text overlay

Once you place the image there, the hero section will display it automatically.

For now, I'll use a CSS gradient background as a fallback.
